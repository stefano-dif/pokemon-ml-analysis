# Pokémon Data Analysis & Modeling

This is a project focused on exploring and modeling Pokémon data for fun and learning.

## Project Structure

- Python_code/
    - scripts for data cleaning, visualization, and modeling
    - requirements.txt (Python dependencies)
- R_code/
    - generic data inspection scripts
    - renv.lock (R dependencies)
- data/
    - original raw data files: `pokemon.csv` and `images`
    - transformed/cleaned data files
- output/
    - training logs
    - saved models


## Details
- `Python_code`: Contains the main workflow scripts for data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning modeling of Pokémon data.

- `R_code`: Currently includes a generic script for inspecting the Pokémon data, still incomplete.
    
- `data`: Stores both the original datasets and the cleaned/transformed versions used in modeling.

- `output`: Holds logs generated during model training and the saved models themselves.
